# Porter: Load Balancer Implementation for Bare Metal

![logo](doc/img/porter-logo.png)

Porter is an open-source load balancer implementation designed for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters.

## Why Porter

In cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, services are usually exposed by using load balancers provided by cloud vendors. However, cloud-based load balancers are unavailable in bare-metal environments. Porter allows users to create LoadBalancer services in bare-metal environments for external access, and provides the same user experience as cloud-based load balancers.

## Core Features

- BGP mode and Layer 2 mode
- ECMP routing and load balancing
- IP address pool management
- BGP configuration using CRDs
- Installation using Helm and KubeSphere

## Documentation

Without a bare-metal environment yet? Doesn't matter!

You can learn how to use Porter in a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster by following the [Porter Documentation](./doc/index.md).
