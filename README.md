OpenELB is an open-source load balancer implementation designed for exposing the LoadBalancer type of Kubernetes services in bare metal, edge, and virtualization environments.

## Why OpenELB

In cloud-based Kubernetes clusters, Services are usually exposed by using load balancers provided by cloud vendors. However, cloud-based load balancers are unavailable in bare-metal or on-premise environments. OpenELB allows users to create **LoadBalancer Services** in bare-metal, egde, and virtualization environments for external access, and provides the same user experience as cloud-based load balancers.

## Core Features

- Load balancing in BGP mode and Layer 2 mode
- ECMP routing and load balancing
- IP address pool management
- BGP configuration using CRDs
- Installation using Helm Chart

## Quickstart
